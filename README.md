1.)   🌿 Medicinal Herbal Plant Identification using Deep Learning
📌 Overview

This project focuses on the automatic identification of medicinal herbal plants using deep learning techniques.
The goal is to build a classification model that can recognize and distinguish between different medicinal plants from images, aiding in research, healthcare, and conservation.

🚀 Features

Image classification of medicinal herbal plants.

Deep Learning models (CNN / Transfer Learning like VGG16, EfficientNet).

Trained and evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployed in a Jupyter/Google Colab environment for easy usage.

📂 Dataset

Images of medicinal herbal plants collected from open-source datasets.

Preprocessed with resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Split into training, validation, and testing sets.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras (for building the model)

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)

Google Colab (for training and execution)

⚙️ Model Architecture

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple layers.

Transfer Learning (VGG16 / EfficientNet) for improved accuracy.

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

📊 Results

Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset.

Model evaluation includes confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
